## Compiler Projects
These are the directories for my compilers:  
  - **Python-based compilers:** Source code for Compilers that are written in Python, you should check this out if you aren't comfortable in C programming.  
  - **C-based compilers:** Source code for Compilers that are written in C, you should check out the Python-based compilers first, of you aren't very comfortable in C or have never designed a Compiler before.   
  - **CWRU Compilers:** Source code for the compilers that I wrote for my classes at Case Western Reserve University.
